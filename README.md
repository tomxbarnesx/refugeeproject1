#Save Refugees Now Website

We believe in the humanity of refugees. Any person facing the situation our brothers and sisters from Syria, West Africa, South Asia now confront would make similar decisions. They would push for a fuller and safer life. The trials they face are enormous, but not impossible. SAVE REFUGEES NOW pledges to support vulnerable families by providing food, clothing, shelter, education and repatriation resources for those in greatest need.
